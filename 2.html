  10.2 The CSS user agent style sheet and presentational hints
10.2.1 Introduction
The CSS rules given in these subsections are, except where otherwise specified, expected to be used as part of the user-agent level style sheet defaults for all documents that contain HTML elements.

Some rules are intended for the author-level zero-specificity presentational hints part of the CSS cascade; these are explicitly called out as presentational hints.

Some of the rules regarding left and right margins are given here as appropriate for elements whose 'direction' property is 'ltr', and are expected to be flipped around on elements whose 'direction' property is 'rtl'. These are marked "LTR-specific".

Similarly, for the purpose of the rules marked "case-insensitive", user agents are expected to use ASCII case-insensitive matching of attribute values rather than case-sensitive matching, even for attributes in XHTML documents.

These markings only affect the handling of attribute values, not attribute names or element names.
